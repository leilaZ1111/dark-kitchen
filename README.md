## Description
Two months into our training, our team was given the challenge to build a single-page website for online food delivery. The goal was to create a visually appealing platform that provides a delightful experience for users. 

In this collaborative project, we were to display a list of dishes using some sort of card templates, categorizable dishes through filters, alight/dark mode switch, and a responsive website.
